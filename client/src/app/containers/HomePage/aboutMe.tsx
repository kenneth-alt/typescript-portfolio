        <InfoText>
          After 4 years of experience working on engineering projects, I made a career transition to Software development, DevOps and cloud computing in 2019, giving me the opportunity to finally explore my deeply-rooted interest in technology that had remained latent until then. I am super passionate about technology and problem-solving, and have a lifelong learning attitude as a personal culture.

        <InfoText>
          My programming expertise includes JavaScript, Node.js, React, Express, MongoDB, Python, Flask, and MySQL. I have hands-on DevOps experience working with CI/CD pielines, cloud services, Docker, Kubernetes, and RESTful APIs. Additionally, I have a strong understanding of AWS and Azure cloud ecosystems, and I am proficient in infrastructure as code using Terraform and CloudFormation, configuration management with Ansible and scripting and automation using Bash and Python.

        <InfoText>
          I excel at balancing autonomy and teamwork, and am committed to continuous learning to stay updated with the latest technology and industry standards. With my helpful personality, self-driven approach to problem-solving, and team spirit, I would be a valuable addition to any team seeking a skilled Software/DevOps Engineer.
